::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

FCGI::Daemon is a small FastCGI server useful for nginx web server.

It features 
    * setrlimit for RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_CPU
    * DOing - run CGI *.pl scripts with persistent interpreter (like mod_perl).
    * detection of memory leaks
    * drop privileges when run as root
    * detection of script executable in path (to run CGI apps like fossil)

It was developed as replacement for cgiwrap-fcgi.pl ( see http://wiki.nginx.org/SimpleCGI )

Pretty much as mod_perl it accelerate CGI scripts written in Perl (*.pl) due to persistent interpreter.
